Description

This project is the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB Clone. It focuses on creating a command interpreter to manage data models for various objects (e.g., User, Place, etc.). The command interpreter will serve as the interface for interacting with the backend of the AirBnB clone, including functionalities like creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of objects.

The project will also introduce you to important concepts such as serialization/deserialization, file storage, and the use of Python packages.
Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a Python program that functions as a simple shell for managing AirBnB objects.
Features

    Interactive Mode: Use the command interpreter interactively for real-time input.
    Non-Interactive Mode: Pipe commands into the interpreter for automated execution.
    Object Management:
        Create, update, delete objects (e.g., User, Place, City).
        Perform operations like counting or computing stats.
